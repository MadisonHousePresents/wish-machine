  <div class="introduction">
		<p>So many of us wish for change in the world today. When the Forest Family thinks globally, we find a place that needs kindness.</p>

		<p>Kindness, radical acceptance, and good deeds are why The Forest is special. These values create freedom to discover ourselves and celebrate our beautiful differences and unique gifts.</p>

		<p>The EF2018 Wish Machine sparked inspiration across the globe. The Forest Family went out into the world and did their part to make it a better place for all - Fundraising money and awareness for mental health, rare diseases, and sustainable efforts; Donating clothing, personal items, and funds to charity drives and disaster clean up efforts; Volunteering countless hours of time and energy to local humane societies, hospitals, and homeless shelters; and many more.</p>

		<p>From planting trees and empowering communities, to starting important conversations and raising awareness, the Forest Family brought the essence of The Forest with them - to people, neighborhoods, communities, and societies across the planet.</p>
